# GitHub Updater Script
The GitHub Updater Script (updater) is a basic python script that will keep projects hosted and released with GitHub up-to-date. It's incredibly useful for downloading things such as server binaries that aren't distributed in a way that is convenient to download again. With the GitHub Updater Script, after you set the URL to the project's overview and a few search filters in the config, all you have to do is run `updater` or `updater update` and it will automatically download the latest version available on the project's releases page.

The example default project is [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot) by John "[jagrosh](https://github.com/jagrosh)" Grosh. It serves as a template for how you should enter the information for your own projects
